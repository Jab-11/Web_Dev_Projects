            Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life, as well as
            being motivated. According to a study by Michiko Kumano, feeling
            ikigai as described in Japanese usually means the feeling of
            accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their
            passions. Activities that generate the feeling of ikigai are not
            forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and
            undertaken willingly, and thus are personal and depend on a person's
            inner self.

            According to psychologist Katsuya Inoue, ikigai is a concept
            consisting of two aspects: "sources or objects that bring value or
            meaning to life" and "a feeling that one's life has value or meaning
            because of the existence of its source or object". Inoue classifies
            ikigai into three directions - social ikigai, non-social ikigai, and
            anti-social ikigai - from a social perspective. Social ikigai refers
            to ikigai that are accepted by society through volunteer activities
            and circle activities.
