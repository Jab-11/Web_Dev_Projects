            In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a
            monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and
            power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the
            ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts
            and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of
            us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can
            all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the
            gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone
            can—and should—think like a monk.

            Shetty reconnected with old school friends—many working for some of
            the world's largest corporations—who were experiencing tremendous
            stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach
            them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness. Since then, Shetty has
            become one of the world's most popular influencers.
