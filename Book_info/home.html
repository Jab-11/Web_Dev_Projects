            Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life, as well as
            being motivated. According to a study by Michiko Kumano, feeling
            ikigai as described in Japanese usually means the feeling of
            accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their
            passions. Activities that generate the feeling of ikigai are not
            forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and
            undertaken willingly, and thus are personal and depend on a person's
            inner self.
            </p>
            <p>
            According to psychologist Katsuya Inoue, ikigai is a concept
            consisting of two aspects: "sources or objects that bring value or
            meaning to life" and "a feeling that one's life has value or meaning
            because of the existence of its source or object". Inoue classifies
            ikigai into three directions - social ikigai, non-social ikigai, and
            anti-social ikigai - from a social perspective. Social ikigai refers
            to ikigai that are accepted by society through volunteer activities
            and circle activities.

            In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a
            monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and
            power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the
            ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts
            and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of
            us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can
            all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the
            gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone
            can—and should—think like a monk.
            </p>
            <p>
            Shetty reconnected with old school friends—many working for some of
            the world's largest corporations—who were experiencing tremendous
            stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach
            them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness. Since then, Shetty has
            become one of the world's most popular influencers.
